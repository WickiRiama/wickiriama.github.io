# Bubble Tearapy

A 2D point and click scrolling game.

## Description

It is a team project, developped in Typescript and PHP with Phaser for the 2025 [Gobal Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/).

In a bleak, monochrome world where happiness is nothing but a distant memory, you play the inventor of bubble tea: the first ever colored drink.
Hop on your bike, go around the city and share color with everyone to bring them back their happiness!
